# Assignment 3 – Q1: Row/Column Mastery (Settings Screen)

A Settings screen built with Jetpack Compose: Column as main container, each setting as a Row (label Column + control), with Material 3 and required modifiers.

## Requirements checklist
- [ ] Column as main layout; each row = Row with label (Column) + control (Switch/Checkbox/Slider/Button)
- [ ] `Modifier.weight()` to prevent truncation and align controls
- [ ] At least 6 M3 components (e.g. TopAppBar, Card, ListItem, Switch, Checkbox, Slider, Divider, AssistChip, IconButton, Snackbar)
- [ ] Modifiers: padding, fillMaxWidth, weight, heightIn/sizeIn, align, and one of border/clip/background/clickable
